# VBA-Challenge
Week 2+3, Module 2 Challenge


Mod2_Alphabetical_Testing_ET.bas contains the VBA script which was applied to the "test data".
Mod2_MultipleYearStockData.bas contains the VBA script applied to the analysis of the Stock Market data given to us.

  Both of these files (above) were exported from the Visual Basic function of Excel.


Following the two VBA scripts are the 4 screenshots of the excel sheets following the modification based on the VBA scripts.
  - Screenshot of 2018 year Stock Market Data
  - Screenshot of 2019 year Stock Market Data
  - Screenshot of 2020 year Stock Market Data
  - Screenshot of Alphabetical Testing (test data)
  
  
  With this assignment, I was able to take pre-existing data, condense it into a much more digestible format. 
  This project wanted us to look at the Stock Market throughout a set period of time and how each publicly traded stock fluctuated in price,
  along with the volume of buyers and sellers trading the stock, which therefore impacted the market capitalization/stock value. 
  
If the volume was high and the price at the end of the year was lower in comparison to the beginning of the year, that indicates more sellers/more people selling stock within time period. 
If the volume was high and the price at the end of the year was higer in comparison to the beginnning of the year, that indicates more buyers/more people buying stock wtihin that time period.
